# Some Questions for software engineers (Backend)

## 1. what is difference between hash and encryption?
- Hashing is a one way function, it is used to generate a unique value for a given input. It is used to verify the integrity of the data. It is not reversible. It is used to store passwords in the database.
- Encryption is a two way function, it is used to encrypt the data. It is reversible. It is used to encrypt the data before sending it over the network.

## 2. what is CSRF?
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.
